# omniRemover
A basic tool for the removal of annoying surveys, and the enabling of content hidden by them.
So far automatic survey detection is **VERY** lacking, but manual tools can be useful.

To use, type "javascript: " in your browser, followed by the code contained within the **omniRemoval.js** file, or paste the code inside of a console (preferably), normally triggered by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + I. 

Note that displaying all hidden divs can have undesired effects on the current visited site.
