# omniRemover
A basic tool for the removal of annoying surveys, and the enabling of content hidden by them.
So far automatic survey detection is **VERY** lacking, but manual tools can be useful.

To use, type "javascript: " in your browser, followed by the code contained within the **omniRemoval.js** file, or paste the code inside of a console (preferably), normally triggered by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + I. 

Note that displaying all hidden divs can have undesired effects on the current visited site.

**You can check out a demo of the script over at:**

# Features
* Draggable window that displays hovered DOM element information
* Remove DOM elements on click
* Highlights currently hovered item
* Unhides hidden divs
* Enables disabled buttons and inputs

Automatic survey removal detection still needs work. All features can be toggled.
